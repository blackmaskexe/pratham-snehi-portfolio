What are my objectives to achieve with this portfolio website?

- place to showcase my different skills
- showcase my different accredations
- SHOW MY PROJECTS IN THAT COOL COOL WAY that i spent way too vibe coding and have no idea how that component even works
- a place to contact me (in-website form rather than just handing over my email)
  - when someone clicks on the "contact me" button, a kind of a popup window opens, which has all the different options of my professional reaching out methods like linkedin, email, etc etc

priority of sections on the website:

1. hero (obviously)
2. projects
3. skills
4. timeline?
5. contact / call to action
